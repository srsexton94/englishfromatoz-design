# Pain Points
This section will offer an indepth review of the current 'English from A to Z' layout/functionality, focusing on its current limitations.  This is done in order to help inform possible redesign plans.

#### General Topics to Consider
* Browser compatiability?
* Mobile responsive?
* Outdated design?
* On-page Content Strategy?
* SEO?
* Update own content?
* Messaging unclear?
* Information architecture intuitive?
* Load time?
* Finding Help or Support?
* Unnecessary clicks?
* Accessibility?

## Home Page
### Landing View
* Logo is too word-heavy - should have distinct image and minimal text (just title)
* Too many options in main navigation bar - crowds options and overwhelms user
* 10% off banner is very hard to notice (same colour as chrome browser)
  - perhaps replace with a image-backed pop-up 10-20 seconds after page load (could then also include a clear call to action like asking for email)
* Title is a bit hard to read ontop of background image
* Title is not mobile responsive (does not stay proportional, ie too small text)

### 'Welcome to English from A to Z!'
* Title text is smaller than body text
* Language options text looks almost like a header - should be in an aside, preferably near the top
* The search bar is far too large for a secondary function
  - looks almost like a form (with the 'Get Started Here' button looking like a 'Submit')
* 'Get Started Here' button (or something similar) should be showcased in the very first view (landing) and then repeated throughout the page/site
* 'What we can do for you' section - try and make both the title and bullets shorter/snappier
  - helps with skimmers who don't want to read lots
  - helps ESL students who might get caught up on the excess text

### Meet Our Teachers
* Navigation here is unclear/confusing to user
  - the photos are large and look like the main interactive element, but it was unclear what clicking on them would do
    - I personally expected a pop-up with more information, but it takes you to their sign-up form (which may put off a user not yet intending to sign up)
  - The "Meet our teachers" nav button is smaller/looks secondary but brings you to the page with the expected content
* The size, definition/lighting, and borders of the photos vary wildly - lack of consistency will confuse user
* Possible solution: create a carousel of the teachers photos/names (to still show them on the front page/draw attention to the section) alongside a card with a title "Meet our Teachers" and a link to the page - allows space for a quick "this is why our teachers are awesome" blurb too!

### Student Testimonials
* having the buttons for different types of courses here is confusing
  - detracts attention away from the testimonials
  - testimonials and course types are not clearly related so they should have separate sections
  - having the descriptor words "group," "private," and "online" make the distinction much clearer (was not clear in main nav bar)
* Try putting the testimonials into cards or another element that will distinguish it from the background/call attention to it
  - can even just be a slightly-lighter box with border radius and a *slight* drop shadow - doesn't have to be much!
* Lack of consistency in testimonial sign-off (two with a country, one with a course type) - try and stay consistent
* If you have more testimonials you'd like to include you could display them one at a time!

### Video
* Instruction to watch and the video itself are separated by a horizontal line?  This makes it unclear that they are related
  - the instruction to watch the video instead looks like a footer to the student testimonials
* Instruction phrase and video are also somewhat disproportionate (too small text)
* Video is quite large relative to the page - and since its a little bit lengthier it might do well in a modal pop-up instead!

### Our Current Offerings
* This section repeats the buttons under 'Student Testimonials'
* Format of the three options is inconsistent
  - try having three equal-sized cards side by side, can shift to vertical for mobile view
* Photos don't seem to fit the frame they're in
* The double titles is repetitive - and using `<strong>` tags for the subtitle makes it look more prominent than the title
* 'Try them now for $10 per hour!' gets lost under the photos - can highlight with styling

### YouTube link
* This is topically very disconnected from the class offerings section, but not prominent enough to be its own section
  - This would probably do well to combine with the Introduction video in one section!

### The Bottom multi-part section
* The detail given for 'About Us,' 'Private Lessons and Group Classes,' 'Online Courses,' and 'Video Content for students' seems to detract from the end of your page
  - too much reading
  - user won't be compelled to watch multiple, topically-specific videos on the home page (better housed on their respective pages or just on the YouTube channel)
* 'Read our Blog' seems like it could be it's own section!  Maybe highlight a few articles?
  - Could also make a section pointing towards the 'Resources' tab (all the learning materials and other 'extras' - like the blog! - would be housed here)

### Footer
* There should be another main call to action *super* prominent here before the Footer
  - saves the user from having to scroll all the way back to the top in order to sign up
  - repetitive click options throughout a long scroll page are recommended for accessibility (ie ADA)
* You can really utilize the space in the footer to offer more granular, direct navigation
  - eg. the participant in our UX research scrolled immediately here to find a 'Careers' page link when looking to apply as a teacher
* The 'Terms and Conditions' and 'Privacy Policy' are taking up too much space
  - These should be included for people specifically looking for them, but most users won't interact
* I like the social icons!  very clear and simple navigation (and they open on a new tab! yay!)
* The 'English from A to Z' icon is far too large for a footer (and also not the same icon used elsewhere?)
* You don't need to include the url at the bottom
* Stating your name/title would probably do well nearer to where you state your email

### Throughout Home Page
* You want to keep the main navigation bar traveling down the page with the user as they scroll
* Try and keep text short & sweet
* Group related content into clearly distinguished sections
* Make sure any calls to action are most prominent in their respective sections!


## About
* This section should ideally include:
  - 'What We Do'
  - 'Our Team'
  - 'Contact Us'
* Having 'Our Blog,' 'Teach with us,' and 'Classes/Courses/Lessons' both here and in their own sections adds unnessary complexity to your user flow
  - Especially confusing when a user tries to backtrack their steps or questions the difference between the two pages with the same title

### 'What We Do'
* This section looks alright!  Styling could help make it a bit more compelling but it is perfectly clear!
* You want to separate the 'quotes' from the 'methods' section just like you did the others
* The title 'Language learning quotes' seems a little redundant
  - I like the opening double quotes! Almost like an icon - that should be enough to indicate to the user that they are reading quotes
* You may want to make the writing a bit more brief and/or break up the longer paragraphs somehow
* Indentation (or making the numbers bold/big/coloured) on bulleted lists will make them more clear to the user

### 'Our Team'
* This should combine 'About/OurTeam/OurLeadership' with the main nav link 'Teachers'
  - I would suggest putting each teacher in a equally-formatted card
  - At the bottom of each description put a link to their sign up forms
  - Depending on your tech needs for sign-up, having a calendar display of each teachers' availability would be a nice extra feature!

### 'Contact Us'
*  This section also looks good!  Again I would just distinguish the different elements
* The 'General Inquiries - email'


# Resources
* This (new) section should ideally include the content from:
  - 'Tips'
  - 'eBooks'
  - 'Videos'
  - 'Free Stuff'
* (These are all related 'extras' and having them disconnected adds unnecessary complexity to your user flow)
* General advice for all sections is just to again
  - make sure individual entities you want a user to interact with or pay attention to are distinguished from the background (ie cards)
  - make sure each section is distinguished from one another


## Learn with Us
* This (new) section should ideally include the content from
  - '[Group] Classes'
  - '[Online] Courses'
  - '[Private] Lessons'
* The general advice for distinguishing sections/elements stands, but otherwise I think this would combine fairly smoothly!
* The UX research participant noted that they really liked having the sub nav bar on the side for ease of access
  - Notably though there should not be so many options (ie side nav links for offering types should never link to a list of only one offering) - short & sweet :)



## Teach with Us
* This section looks great!  Same advice about distinguising elements (ie the form vs. text) but otherwise no big suggestions!
  - noting the 'not actively looking' announcement should especially be more prominent
* I would get rid of the smaller 'Teacher Interest Form' title (You only need one)


## Overall
* Links seem to always open in the same tab - opening in a new tab is recommended as user won't feel they've lost their spot (just means adding `target="_blank"` to HTML attributes)
* Titles of pages should match the nav links the user clicked on to get there
  - Eg 'Contact Us' leads to 'Email Us,' 'Our Team' leads to 'Our Leadership'
* Offering content in users' different languages is a great idea but needs to be consistent
  - Eg. our UX research participant was particularly off put when the navigation links stayed in English, and subsequent pages weren't also in her chosen language (Spanish)
  - Once the user selects a language all content should stay in that language until they change it


## That's all folks!
In general I think your website has a ton of great content but the user flow (what steps the user takes to complete an action) and general styling are your biggest points for improvement.

The biggest rule of thumb is to make things as simple/clear as possible for your users. As you might've noticed a theme...
