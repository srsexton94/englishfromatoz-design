# Competitors Comparison
This section reviews the strengths and limitations of business with similar models.services to 'English from A to Z' to better inform the possibilities of development.

## [iTalki](https://www.italki.com/)
Strengths:
* has an authenticated account that allows users to see/track their own information
* social media platform allows for users and teachers to interact on-site
* simple main navbar and detailed dropdowns/footer
* utilizes shadows well to keep sleek design & compartmentalize distinct page elements

Limitations:
* no in-website video hosting (uses other platforms)
* video starting upon landing page's initial load is bad accessibility practice
* no way to view general 'about'/'how to' information after signing in


## [VIPKid](https://www.vipkid.com/)
Strengths:
* Professional, custom imagery - sleek design
* Clear and consistent colour palatte
* multiple click-options for key call to action (good accessibility practice & increases likelihood page visitors click)

Limitations:
* Signing up as a student is inaccessible (though notably, this is likely because they pick up on my location and adjust the page view accordingly - i.e. students are only from China)


## [Voxy](https://voxy.com/)
Strengths:
* landing page effective focuses on selling points (the "why")
* stylish, intentional iconography
* columns in menu drop down options make otherwise crowded options clearer & compartmentalize alike options
* Several click options for main call to action ('Request a Demo')

Limitations:
* having two horizontal nav bars at top confusing/difficult to read
* busy navbar, too many options in main nav - even busier in dropdowns
* having 'solutions overview' and 'request a demo' side by side makes main call to action less intuitive for user
* text on top of busy photographs hard to read - may not reach accessibility standards

## [Verbling](https://www.verbling.com/)
Strengths:
* Call to action and main option (language choice) are both *super* clear to user immediately upon page load
* Option to scroll for more info very intuitive/clear - doesn't disrupt user who just wants to complete main action
* Very dynamic/engaging new user flow
* Teacher profiles consistent and have dynamically rendered video & calendar format to easily view availability
* "Feature Suggestion" is a cool idea for future development! (Would only incorporate after reaching initial goals)

Limitations:
* Vertical carousel strikes me as odd UI/potentially confusing to user (might be better if not exactly against lefthand page border or with an element border/slight dropshadow)
* Subsections of main page (info upon scrolling) strangely sized/formatted - separate options less clear to user
